日至 23 日，河南省遭遇历史罕见特大暴雨。降\n雨过程 17 日至 18 日主要发生在豫北（焦作、新乡、鹤壁、\n安阳）；19 日至 20 日暴雨中心南移至郑州，发生长历时特大\n暴雨；21 日至 22 日暴雨中心再次北移，23 日逐渐减弱结束。\n过程累计面雨量鹤壁最大 589 毫米、郑州次之 534 毫米、新\n乡第三 512 毫米；过程点雨量鹤壁科创中心气象站最大\n1122.6 毫米、郑州新密市白寨气象站次之 993.1 毫米；小时\n最强点雨量郑州最大，发生在 20 日 16 时至 17 时（郑州国\n家气象站 201.9 毫米），鹤壁、新乡晚一天左右，分别发生\n在 21 日 14 时至 15 时（120.5 毫米）和 20 时至 21 时（114.7\n毫米）。特大暴雨引发河南省中北部地区严重汛情，12 条主\n要河流发生超警戒水位以上洪水。全省启用 8 处蓄滞洪区，\n共产主义渠和卫河新乡、鹤壁段多处发生决口。新乡卫辉市\n城区受淹长达 7 天。灾害发生后，应急管理部及时组织专家\n组开展灾害损失综合评估和灾害范围评估，形成评估报告，\n并会同发展改革委、财政部、水利部上报国务院同意，作为\n3\n指导河南省编制灾后恢复重建规划的重要依据。据核查评\n估，河南省共有 150 个县（市、区）1478.6 万人受灾，直接\n经济损失 1200.6 亿元，其中郑州 409 亿元，占全省 34.1%。\n这次特大暴雨是在西太平洋副热带高压异常偏北、夏季\n风偏强等气候背景下，同期形成的 2
