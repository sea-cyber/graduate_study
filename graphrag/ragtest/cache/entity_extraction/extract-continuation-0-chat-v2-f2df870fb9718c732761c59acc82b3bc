Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>PERSON<|>A spirit that shows Scrooge visions of different scenes and people)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>The main character who is being shown the visions by the Ghost)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COSY DINNER<|>EVENT<|>A dinner being prepared with hot plates and deep red curtains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children running out into the snow to meet their family members)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARRIED SISTERS, BROTHERS, COUSINS, UNCLE, AUNTS<|>PERSON<|>Family members arriving for a gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUESTS<|>PERSON<|>People assembling for a friendly gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANDSOME GIRLS<|>PERSON<|>Group of girls going to a neighbor's house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGLE MAN<|>PERSON<|>A man who saw the group of girls enter a house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMPLIGHTER<|>PERSON<|>The person who lights the lamps on the street)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOOR<|>GEO<|>A bleak and desolate area with masses of stones and frosty water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINERS<|>PERSON<|>People who labor in the earth, living in the moor area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD MAN AND WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>An elderly couple singing a Christmas song with their family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHOUSE<|>GEO<|>A solitary lighthouse standing on a reef of sunken rocks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWO MEN<|>PERSON<|>Men watching the light at the lighthouse, sharing a Merry Christmas wish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIP<|>GEO<|>A ship far from any shore where the crew is in a Christmas mood)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOST<|>SCROOGE<|>The Ghost is showing Scrooge the visions of different scenes<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>COSY DINNER<|>Scrooge is seeing a vision of a cosy dinner being prepared<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>CHILDREN<|>Scrooge observes children running out to meet their family<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>MARRIED SISTERS, BROTHERS, COUSINS, UNCLE, AUNTS<|>Children are meeting their extended family members<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUESTS<|>LAMPLIGHTER<|>Guests are assembling as the lamplighter lights up the street<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANDSOME GIRLS<|>SINGLE MAN<|>The single man saw the handsome girls entering a house and felt affected<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOST<|>MOOR<|>The Ghost takes Scrooge to a moor where miners live<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINERS<|>OLD MAN AND WOMAN<|>Miners are part of the cheerful company assembled by the old man and woman<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOST<|>LIGHOUSE<|>The Ghost and Scrooge visit a lighthouse<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWO MEN<|>LIGHOUSE<|>Two men at the lighthouse are having a moment of holiday cheer<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHIP<|>SCROOGE<|>Scrooge, through the Ghost's vision, sees a ship with a crew in festive spirits<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREW<|>CHRISTMAS<|>The crew of the ship is in a Christmas mood, sharing good wishes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
