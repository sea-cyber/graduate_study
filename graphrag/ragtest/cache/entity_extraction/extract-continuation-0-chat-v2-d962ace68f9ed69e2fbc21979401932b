专专业背景。这种\n扭曲的体制设计和薄弱的专业力量，导致防汛抗旱指挥部没\n有实际的指挥系统、指挥机制、指挥能力，失去统一指挥，\n关键时刻不能发挥应有作用。各地要从这次灾害中深刻汲取\n教训，对中央深化应急管理体制改革的决策部署，不能合意\n就执行、不合意就不执行。要坚持改革方向不动摇，深化改\n革部署落实，并加强改革后体制运行磨合和评估，及时完善\n政策措施，加快形成统筹协调、统分结合的“全灾种、大应\n急”工作格局。\n（四）发展理念存在偏差，城市建设“重面子、轻里\n子”。习近平总书记多次强调，城市无论规划、建设还是管\n38\n理，都要把安全放在第一位。郑州市作为新兴特大城市，近\n年来发展速度很快，但考虑防灾减灾不足，防范治理措施不\n到位。雨水管道 2400 余公里，与建成区面积相当的城市相\n比相差超过一半；计划投资 534.8 亿元的海绵城市建设项目，\n已投资的 196.3 亿元中，实际与海绵城市相关的仅占 32%，\n用于景观、绿化等占近 56%，甚至在全国调集力量支援郑州\n抢险救灾的关键时刻还在“修花坛”；排水明沟等设施“十\n三五”期间改造达标率仅 20%，有的排水泵站位于低处极易\n受淹失效，地铁、隧道、立交桥等防涝排涝能力不足，地铁\n区间疏散平台主要考虑防火防烟未考虑防涝，水库溢洪道堵\n塞、城区积水点等安全隐患长期没有排除，医院、供水、通\n信等公共设施的备用电源多位于地下，一进水就失去了备灾\n作用。城市规划建设落实防灾减灾要求不到位，这也是不少\n地方长期存在的共性问题，每年雨季“城中看海”屡屡上演，\n反映了一些领导干部政绩观有偏差，在完整准确全面贯彻新\n发展理念、统筹发展和安全上存在很大差距，没有把安全工\n作落实到城市工作和城市发展各个环节各个领域。\n（五）应急管理体系和能力薄弱，预警与响应联动机制\n不健全等问题突出。这次暴雨灾害集中暴露出郑州市预警发\n布能力、应急指挥能力、抢险救援能力、社会动员能力、科\n技支撑能力不足等诸多短板。特别是灾害性天气预报与灾害\n预警混淆，预警发布部门分割，防灾避灾措施针对性、有效\n性、强制性不足，缺乏统一权威高效的预警发布机制；预警\n与响应联动机制不健全，谁响应、如何响应不明确，郑州在\n39\n连发 5 次红色预警的情况下才启动Ⅰ级响应，实际灾难已经\n发生；应急预案实用性不强，多以出现严重后果为启动条件，\n往往启动偏晚，不符合“两个坚持、三个转\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>防汛抗旱指挥部<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Responsible for
