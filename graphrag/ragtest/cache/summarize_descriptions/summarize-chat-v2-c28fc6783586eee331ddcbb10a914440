It has been at the forefront of discussions regarding its flood prevention and drought relief plan, as well as the role of its water conservancy bureau. Unfortunately, the city has faced challenges in flood control and disaster relief efforts, as evidenced by the ineffective responses during a flooding event. The city's leadership, including the municipal committee and the municipal government, has faced scrutiny for their responsibilities in flood prevention and relief.\n\nZhengzhou was the site of the \"7·20\" extreme rainstorm disaster, which resulted in the tragic loss and disappearance of 129 people.
